## What is the Choi Bar?

The Choi Bar is a an entry to the belly down armbar. As seen below, to perform the traditional belly down armbar the attacker would rotate away from the opponent bringing thier leg, on the same side as the arm which they are attacking, over the opponents shoulder.

Now to perform the *Choi Bar* entry to the belly down armbar the attacker will rotate towards the opponent and bring the opposite side leg over the opponents shoulder and head.
