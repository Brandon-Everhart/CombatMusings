## Overview

The Choi Bar is a an entry to the belly down armbar. The Choi Bar is named after an Atos  competitor, Choi Won Choi, who won several matches with the armbar in his weight class and open class at IBJJF Worlds 2014. After Choi Won Choi defeated Lachlan Giles with the Choi Bar, both Lachlan and Craig Jones began to teach the move and increase the moves popularity in the last 5 years. However, the Choi Bar has seen an explosion of interest after Mica Galvao [A] and Eoghan O'Flanagan [B] used the Choi Bar at 2022 ADCC Worlds. The movement is differentiated by rotating towards our opponent and bringing the far leg around or over our opponents head and shoulder then threading that leg in front of the opponents hips, landing us in the belly down armbar.

Commonly the Choi Bar is used from various variations of half guard, primarily from Knee Shield Half Guard or Butterfly Half Guard as seen in O'Flanagan vs Ribeiro [a, 3].
